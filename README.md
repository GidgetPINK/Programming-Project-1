# Programming-Project-1
Use mouseover and mouseout to change the image of flags to their corresponding country while also /n
changing the title of the page to match the country.

Instructions
For this assignment:
• It is assumed you will use properly formatted HTML using good formatting, including the DOCTYPE, meta charset element, and that you will use an external JavaScript file and appropriate script source link.
• The scripts should be in a subfolder inside the folder where the HTML files are
• The images should also be in a separate subfolder, named images
For this assignment, you must create a Webpage, index.html, which links to a JavaScript file, flags.js. In the HTML document you should have at least three flags that are adjusted to be approximately the same size. When you hover over a flag with your mouse, another similarly sized image of the country which the flag represents should be displayed.
Additionally, there should be an <h1> tag at the top of the Webpage. By default it says, “Countries and Flags”. Whenever you hover over one of the flag images, not only should the image switch to the map, but you should
also change the text of the h1 to be the name of that country.
When your mouse is no longer over an image, the text of the h1 should be restored to the default.
Hints
Consider using functions such as document.getElementById and document.querySelector(‘h1’); for example to obtain references to your DOM objects.
